# PortScanner
The Python Port Scanner is a command-line tool for checking open ports on a target system. It helps identify potential vulnerabilities by probing a range of ports, making it valuable for network administrators and security professionals.

## Brief Introduction:
The Python Port Scanner is a versatile script that can help you discover open ports on a remote system. It operates by attempting to establish a connection to each port within the specified range on the target host. If a connection can be successfully established, it means the port is open and accessible. Conversely, if a connection cannot be made, the port is likely closed or filtered by a firewall.

## How to Use:
Download the Script: First, make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

1.`git clone https://github.com/Maveera/PortScanner.git`
2.`cd PortScanner`
3.`python3 PortScanner.py`
#### Run the Script: 
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located. To run the script, use the `python`
